	<p id="fruit_description">A fruit is a part of a flowering plant that derives from specific 
				 			  tissues of the flower,<br> one or more ovaries, and in some cases accessory tissues. 
				 			  <br>Fruits are the means by which these plants disseminate seeds.<br>
				 			  </p>
	<p id="vegetable_description">The non-biological definition of a vegetable is largely based on culinary and cultural tradition. <br>Vegetables are most often consumed as salads or cooked in savory or salty dishes,
								<br> while culinary fruits are usually sweet and used for desserts,<br> but it is not the universal rule.
								  </p>	
	 <p id="bean_description">The term bean originally referred to the seed of the broad or fava bean, <br>but was later expanded to include 
	 						  members of the New World genus Phaseolus,<br> such as the common bean and the runner bean, and the related genus 
	 						  Vigna.</p>
